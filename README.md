# Executive Summary
My capstone project is about analysis of restaurant ratings on Yelp, with focus on restaurants in the Nashville area. The aim of this project is to determine factors that contribute to a restaurant’s overall rating and customer satisfaction which can provide valuable insights to both restaurant owners and customers. The data to be used comes from Yelp’s downloadable dataset. 

# Motivation
With customer ratings being readily available and having significant influence on customers’ decisions to visit a restaurant, it will be helpful for restaurants to understand the key factors that contribute to a higher rating on Yelp’s platform. 

# Data Question
This project aims to answer the question: “What factors influence a customer's rating of a restaurant on Yelp’s platform?” A similar problem has been explored by Zefang Liu: “Yelp Review Rating Prediction: Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models” on the Yelp platform. 

# Minimum Viable Product
The minimum viable product of the project will be a machine learning model that can predict a restaurant’s rating based on customer review text and other features. Prediction accuracy will be measured using the appropriate metric for the model. 

# Data Sources
Yelp’s downloadable dataset will be used for this project. 

# Known Issues and Challenges
I anticipate having some challenge in cleaning the data and transforming it to a useable format for analysis and model building. Additionally, there may be differences in the use of language in Yelp that can have different meanings based on context. To overcome this, I plan to research previous projects that have dealt with similar issues and adopt their approach.
